1 / 1

Yes, you can get the image ID without downloading the image to your local machine by using the Docker Registry API. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  Get the registry authentication token:

bash

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s "https://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:${image_name}:pull" | jq -r .token)
```

Make sure to replace `${image_name}` with the desired image name, including the namespace (e.g., `library/ubuntu`). You will need `jq` installed to parse the JSON response. If you don't have it, you can install it using package managers like `apt`, `yum`, or `brew`.

2.  Retrieve the manifest of the image with the desired tag:

bash

```bash
MANIFEST=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -H 'Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json' "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/${image_name}/manifests/${tag}")
```

Replace `${tag}` with the desired tag (e.g., `latest`).

3.  Extract the image ID (digest) from the manifest:

bash

```bash
IMAGE_ID=$(echo $MANIFEST | jq -r '.config.digest')
```

After running these commands, `${IMAGE_ID}` will contain the image ID without having to pull the image locally.

Please note that these commands are designed for Docker Hub. If you're using a different registry, you might need to adjust the URLs and authentication methods accordingly.

> my docker registry is \`registry.sensetime.com/xlab/\`. If I need to know image id of \`registry.sensetime.com/xlab/emigmo/egovlp:latest\`, how can I get that?

1 / 1

To get the image ID for an image hosted on a private registry, you'll need to modify the previous commands to use the appropriate endpoints and credentials for your specific registry.

Here's a step-by-step guide for `registry.sensetime.com/xlab/`:

1.  Log in to the registry using your credentials. You should have your username and password ready:

`docker login registry.sensetime.com`

2.  After logging in, locate the `auth` field in your `~/.docker/config.json` file. This field contains a Base64 encoded string of your login credentials in the format `username:password`. You can extract this token using the following command:

javascript

```javascript
AUTH_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.auths["registry.sensetime.com"].auth' ~/.docker/config.json)
```

3.  Set the image name and tag variables:

makefile

```makefile
image_name="xlab/emigmo/egovlp"
tag="latest"
```

4.  Retrieve the manifest of the image with the desired tag:

bash

```bash
MANIFEST=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Basic ${AUTH_TOKEN}" -H 'Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json' "https://registry.sensetime.com/v2/${image_name}/manifests/${tag}")
```

5.  Extract the image ID (digest) from the manifest:

bash

```bash
IMAGE_ID=$(echo $MANIFEST | jq -r '.config.digest')
```

After running these commands, `${IMAGE_ID}` will contain the image ID of the specified image without having to pull the image locally. Keep in mind that you should replace the image name and tag with the ones you want to inspect.

> is there a way combine 4 and 5 in one command?

1 / 1

Yes, you can combine steps 4 and 5 into a single command by piping the output of `curl` directly to `jq`. Here's the combined command:

bash

```bash
IMAGE_ID=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Basic ${AUTH_TOKEN}" -H 'Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json' "https://registry.sensetime.com/v2/${image_name}/manifests/${tag}" | jq -r '.config.digest')
```

This command retrieves the manifest and extracts the image ID (digest) in one line. Make sure you've already executed the previous steps to set the `image_name`, `tag`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` variables.

> How to run shell in python

1 / 1

In Python, you can run shell commands using the `subprocess` module. The `subprocess.run()` function is the recommended way to run shell commands in Python 3.5 and later.

Here's an example of how to run a shell command using `subprocess.run()`:

python

```python
import subprocess

# Run a simple shell command and capture the output
result = subprocess.run(['echo', 'Hello, World!'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

# Check the return code (0 means success)
if result.returncode == 0:
    print(f'Success! Output: {result.stdout}')
else:
    print(f'Error! Return code: {result.returncode}')
```

In this example, we're running the `echo` command with the argument `Hello, World!`. The `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` argument tells `subprocess.run()` to capture the output of the command. The `text=True` argument tells it to return the output as a string instead of bytes.

To run a shell command with multiple arguments, you can pass them as a list. For example:

python

```python
import subprocess

command = ['ls', '-l']
result = subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

if result.returncode == 0:
    print(f'Success! Output:\n{result.stdout}')
else:
    print(f'Error! Return code: {result.returncode}\nError output:\n{result.stderr}')
```

This code runs the `ls -l` command and captures both the standard output (`stdout`) and the standard error output (`stderr`). If the command succeeds, it prints the output. If it fails, it prints the return code and error output.

> I failed to run command with pipe

1 / 1

If you want to run a command with a pipe (|) in Python, you need to set `shell=True` for the `subprocess.run()` function. However, keep in mind that using `shell=True` can be a security risk if you're executing untrusted input.

Here's an example of running a command with a pipe:

python

```python
import subprocess

# Command with a pipe
command = 'echo "Hello, World!" | grep -o World'

# Run the command with shell=True
result = subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True, shell=True)

# Check the return code (0 means success)
if result.returncode == 0:
    print(f'Success! Output: {result.stdout.strip()}')
else:
    print(f'Error! Return code: {result.returncode}\nError output:\n{result.stderr}')
```

In this example, the `echo "Hello, World!" | grep -o World` command is used, which contains a pipe. By setting `shell=True`, the command is run in a shell, allowing the use of pipes and other shell features.

Keep in mind that using `shell=True` can lead to security issues if you're executing commands with untrusted input. Always validate and sanitize the input to avoid code injection vulnerabilities.

> How to get the output text string of the command? How to print the result simultanously when running?

1 / 1

To get the output text string of a command and print the result simultaneously while running, you can use the `subprocess.Popen()` function with a while loop to read the output line by line.

Here's an example of how to do this:

python

```python
import subprocess

# Command with a pipe
command = 'echo "Hello, World!" | grep -o World'

# Run the command with shell=True
process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True, shell=True)

# Read and print the output line by line
output = ''
for line in process.stdout:
    print(line.strip())
    output += line

# Wait for the command to finish and get the return code
returncode = process.wait()

# Check the return code (0 means success)
if returncode == 0:
    print(f'Success! Output: {output.strip()}')
else:
    print(f'Error! Return code: {returncode}')
```

In this example, the `subprocess.Popen()` function is used to run the command. The for loop reads the output line by line and prints it while the command is running. The `output` variable accumulates the output text, and the `process.wait()` function is called to wait for the command to finish and get the return code.

> How to get the total size of a remote docker image (from dockerhub) without pulling it to local?

1 / 1

To get the total size of a remote Docker image without pulling it, you can use the Docker Registry API to fetch the image manifest and calculate the total size. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  Get the registry authentication token:

bash

```bash
image_name="library/ubuntu" # Replace with the desired image name (including namespace if applicable)
tag="latest" # Replace with the desired tag
TOKEN=$(curl -s "https://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:${image_name}:pull" | jq -r .token)
```

2.  Retrieve the manifest of the image with the desired tag:

bash

```bash
MANIFEST=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -H 'Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json' "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/${image_name}/manifests/${tag}")
```

3.  Extract the size of each layer from the manifest:

bash

```bash
LAYER_SIZES=$(echo $MANIFEST | jq '.layers[].size')
```

4.  Sum the sizes of all layers to get the total size:

bash

```bash
TOTAL_SIZE=0
for size in $LAYER_SIZES; do
  TOTAL_SIZE=$((TOTAL_SIZE + size))
done
```

5.  Print the total size:

bash

```bash
echo "Total size of ${image_name}:${tag} is ${TOTAL_SIZE} bytes."
```

This script retrieves the manifest of the specified Docker image from Docker Hub, extracts the size of each layer, and calculates the total size by summing the layer sizes.

Please note that this script assumes you're using Docker Hub. If you want to retrieve the size of an image from a different registry, you might need to adjust the URLs and authentication methods accordingly. Also, make sure you have `jq` installed to parse the JSON responses.

> 
> Why the size I computed using method above is lower than the SIZE using \`docker images\`

1 / 1

The difference in size between the result you get from the Docker Registry API and the size displayed by `docker images` is due to the fact that they represent different things.

The size you compute using the Docker Registry API is the sum of the compressed sizes of the image layers as they are stored in the registry. These layers are compressed to save storage space and minimize the amount of data that needs to be transferred when pulling images.

On the other hand, the size displayed by `docker images` is the size of the image layers on your local system after they have been decompressed and stored. This size is generally larger than the compressed size because the layers are stored in an uncompressed format on your local system, which allows for faster access and usage.

As a result, the size you get from the Docker Registry API will typically be smaller than the size reported by `docker images` because the former represents the compressed size while the latter represents the decompressed size.
