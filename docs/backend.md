> I'm using gevent and flask\_socketio and add \`monkey.patch\_all(thread=False)\` at the front of app.py. I created worker thread by \`threading.Thread(target=worker)\`. And in function worker, I use socketio to emit message by \`socketio.emit('status\_change', {'row\_id': table\_row.id, 'status': 'uploading'}, namespace='/table')\`. However, the frontend \`main.js\` did not receive socketio event. The codes are \`socket.on('status\_change', function(data) {...})\`

1 / 1

It looks like you're trying to emit an event from the worker thread to the frontend using Flask-SocketIO and gevent. There might be a few reasons why the frontend is not receiving the event. I'll suggest some possible solutions to help you debug the issue.

1.  Ensure Flask-SocketIO is properly initialized:

Make sure you have properly initialized Flask-SocketIO in your `app.py`. Your code should look similar to this:

python

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_socketio import SocketIO

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
socketio = SocketIO(app, async_mode='gevent')
```

2.  Use `socketio.start_background_task()`:

Instead of using the `threading.Thread`, it's recommended to use the `start_background_task()` method provided by Flask-SocketIO when working with background tasks. This ensures that the task runs in a way that is compatible with the asynchronous framework being used (gevent in your case).

Change your worker thread creation code to look like this:

python

```python
def worker():
    ...
    socketio.emit('status_change', {'row_id': table_row.id, 'status': 'uploading'}, namespace='/table')

socketio.start_background_task(worker)
```

3.  Ensure correct namespace and event names:

Make sure that you're using the correct namespace in both your backend and frontend code. In your case, it should be `/table`. Also, double-check the event names ('status\_change') to make sure they match.

In your `main.js`:

javascript

```javascript
const socket = io.connect('/table');

socket.on('status_change', function (data) {
  // Your code here
});
```

4.  Emit the event to a specific room:

If you want to emit the event to a specific room, you can use the `room` parameter when emitting the event:

python

```python
socketio.emit('status_change', {'row_id': table_row.id, 'status': 'uploading'}, namespace='/table', room='<room_name>')
```

5.  Check for any errors or warnings:

Check your server logs for any error messages or warnings related to Flask-SocketIO or gevent. This could help you identify any potential issues that may be causing the problem.

6.  Test the connection:

Make sure that the frontend is properly connected to the server. You can test this by emitting a test event from the server and listening to it on the frontend.

In your `app.py`:

python

```python
@socketio.on('connect', namespace='/table')
def test_connect():
    print('Client connected')
    socketio.emit('status_change', {'row_id': 0, 'status': 'test'}, namespace='/table')
```

In your `main.js`:

javascript

```javascript
socket.on('status_change', function (data) {
  console.log('Received data:', data);
});
```

This should help you identify the issue and fix it. If the problem persists, please provide more information about your code, and I'd be happy to help you further.

> I receive a WARNING in \_\_init\_\_: WebSocket transport not available. Install gevent-websocket for improved performance.

1 / 1

This warning suggests that you do not have the `gevent-websocket` package installed, which can provide better performance for WebSocket connections when using gevent with Flask-SocketIO. To resolve this warning, you need to install the `gevent-websocket` package.

You can install it using pip:

bash

```bash
pip install gevent-websocket
```

After installing the package, the warning should disappear, and Flask-SocketIO will use the WebSocket transport provided by gevent-websocket. This should improve the performance of your application when using WebSockets.

Please note that installing the `gevent-websocket` package might not directly solve the issue with the frontend not receiving the event, but it will improve the overall performance of your WebSocket connections. If your frontend still doesn't receive the event after installing `gevent-websocket`, refer to the previous suggestions to debug the issue further.

Here' s my start command: \`\`\` from gevent import monkey monkey.patch\_all(thread=False) app = Flask(\_\_name\_\_) app.config\['SQLALCHEMY\_DATABASE\_URI'\] = 'sqlite:///editable\_table.db' db = SQLAlchemy(app) task\_queue = queue.Queue() with app.app\_context(): Session = scoped\_session(sessionmaker(bind=db.engine)) db.create\_all() socketio = SocketIO(app, cors\_allowed\_origins="\*", async\_mode='gevent') socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True) \`\`\`

1 / 1

The code you provided should start your Flask application with gevent and listen on `0.0.0.0:8080`. However, if you're experiencing issues and the application seems to be stuck, there might be a problem elsewhere in your code.

Here are a few suggestions to help you debug the issue:

1.  Ensure correct indentation:

Make sure your indentation is correct, especially for the `socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True)` line. It should be at the same level as the `socketio` initialization.

2.  Check for blocking code:

Verify that there is no blocking code (e.g., an infinite loop, a blocking operation) in other parts of your application that may be causing the application to become stuck.

3.  Check for errors and warnings:

Look for any error messages or warnings in your logs that might give you more information about the issue.

4.  Test without gevent:

You can try running your application without gevent to see if the issue is related to gevent itself. To do this, comment out the first two lines related to gevent and set the `async_mode` to `None` when initializing the `SocketIO` object:

python

```python
# from gevent import monkey
# monkey.patch_all(thread=False)

socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*", async_mode=None)
```

This will run your application using the default Flask development server. If the application works correctly without gevent, the issue may be related to gevent. In that case, you can investigate further and potentially consider using an alternative async mode (e.g., `eventlet`).

5.  Test without Flask-SocketIO:

To further narrow down the issue, you can try running your application without Flask-SocketIO. Comment out the lines related to Flask-SocketIO and use the standard Flask `app.run()` method:

python

```python
# socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*", async_mode='gevent')
# socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True)

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```

If the application works without Flask-SocketIO, the issue may be related to the Flask-SocketIO integration. In that case, you can investigate further and potentially consider using a different WebSocket library, such as Flask-Sockets.

By trying these suggestions, you should be able to identify the issue and resolve it. If the problem persists, please provide more information about your code and the issue, and I'd

> It worked without gevent and \`monkey.patch\_all(thread=False)\`. How can I use async mode \`eventlet\` alternatively?

1 / 1

To switch from `gevent` to `eventlet` as the async mode for Flask-SocketIO, follow these steps:

1.  Install the `eventlet` package:

You will need to install the `eventlet` package using pip:

bash

```bash
pip install eventlet
```

2.  Update your `app.py`:

Remove the `gevent` imports and the `monkey.patch_all(thread=False)` line. Flask-SocketIO will automatically detect and use `eventlet` as the async mode if it's installed. You don't need to explicitly set the `async_mode` parameter when initializing the `SocketIO` object. Your updated code should look like this:

python

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_socketio import SocketIO
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///editable_table.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
task_queue = queue.Queue()
with app.app_context():
    Session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=db.engine))
    db.create_all()

socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")
socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True)
```

With these changes, your application should now be using `eventlet` as the async mode for Flask-SocketIO. If you encounter any issues, please make sure you have correctly installed the `eventlet` package and have removed any references to `gevent` and `monkey.patch_all(thread=False)` in your code.

> However, when I start my program with worker thread. It stuck at \`waiter.acuire()\`. Here's part of my code: \`\`\` def worker(): global worker\_idle while True: data = task\_queue.get() for i in range(worker\_count): socketio.start\_background\_task(worker) \`\`\`

1 / 1

It seems that your application is getting stuck because the worker threads are waiting to get data from the `task_queue`. If the queue is empty and no data is being added to it, the worker threads will block indefinitely, causing your application to appear stuck.

To resolve this issue, you can use the `task_queue.get(block=False)` method to prevent the worker threads from blocking when the queue is empty. However, this will cause the worker threads to constantly check the queue, which might consume more CPU resources.

A better approach is to use a timeout value with the `get()` method. This way, the worker threads will wait for the specified timeout before checking the queue again. Here's an example of how to do this:

python

```python
def worker():
    global worker_idle
    while True:
        try:
            data = task_queue.get(block=True, timeout=1)  # Wait for 1 second before checking the queue again
        except queue.Empty:
            # If the queue is empty, do something else, or just continue waiting
            continue

for i in range(worker_count):
    socketio.start_background_task(worker)
```

With this change, your worker threads will wait for 1 second before checking the queue again if it's empty. This should prevent your application from getting stuck and also avoid consuming too much CPU when the queue is empty.

Additionally, ensure that you're adding data to the `task_queue` elsewhere in your code, so the worker threads have something to process.

> 1 / 1
> 
> It doesn't work. The program still stucks

1 / 1

I apologize for the confusion. Let's try another approach to ensure that the issue isn't related to the worker threads.

1.  Temporarily disable the worker threads:

Comment out the worker thread initialization code to see if your application still gets stuck:

python

```python
# for i in range(worker_count):
#    socketio.start_background_task(worker)
```

If your application runs without getting stuck, it means the issue is indeed related to the worker threads.

2.  Add logging to your worker function:

Add some logging statements to your `worker()` function to better understand where the application is getting stuck:

python

```python
import logging

def worker():
    global worker_idle
    while True:
        try:
            logging.info("Waiting for data from the task_queue...")
            data = task_queue.get(block=True, timeout=1)  # Wait for 1 second before checking the queue again
            logging.info("Received data from
```

> 1 / 1
> 
> It does not stuck if I comment worker threads initialization

1 / 1

Since your application does not get stuck when you comment out the worker thread initialization, it suggests that the issue is related to the worker threads. In this case, let's try an alternative approach to run your worker threads using `eventlet` instead of Flask-SocketIO's `start_background_task()` method.

1.  Import eventlet's `spawn()` method:

At the beginning of your `app.py`, import the `spawn()` method from the `eventlet` package:

python

```python
import eventlet
eventlet.monkey_patch()
```

Note that we've also added `eventlet.monkey_patch()` here, as it's generally a good idea to use it when working with `eventlet`.

2.  Replace `start_background_task()` with `eventlet.spawn()`:

Replace the `socketio.start_background_task(worker)` line with `eventlet.spawn(worker)`:

python

```python
for i in range(worker_count):
    eventlet.spawn(worker)
```

Now, your worker threads will be managed by `eventlet` instead of Flask-SocketIO's `start_background_task()` method. This should help prevent your application from getting stuck while still allowing your worker threads to run in the background.

If your application continues to experience issues, there might be a problem in how your worker threads interact with other parts of your code. In this case, you may need to review your code to ensure that there are no deadlocks, race conditions, or other concurrency-related issues.

Keep in mind that working with threads in a web application can be complex, and it's essential to have a good understanding of how to manage shared resources and prevent race conditions. If you continue to experience issues, consider reviewing the documentation for the libraries you're using, and feel free to ask for help as needed.

> It worked. However, when I stop the program and rerun, it happenned again! \`listen on 0.0.0.0:8080\` is not shown

1 / 1

I'm glad that the previous solution worked, but it's concerning that the issue reoccurred when you restarted the program. This behavior might be related to the port not being released properly when the application is stopped. Here are a few suggestions to help you troubleshoot the issue:

1.  Manually close the socket connections in your application:

Add the following code to your `app.py` to close the socket connections when your application is terminated:

python

```python
import signal
import sys

def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    print("Closing socket connections...")
    socketio.stop()  # Close the Socket.IO connections
    sys.exit(0)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
```

This code will catch the `SIGINT` signal (generated when you press `Ctrl+C` to stop the application) and close the Socket.IO connections before exiting.

2.  Wait for a few seconds before restarting your application:

Sometimes, the operating system takes a few seconds to release the port after the application is stopped. Wait for a few seconds before restarting your application to ensure that the port has been released.

3.  Check if another process is using the port:

Ensure that no other process is using the same port (8080) when you restart your application. You can use the following commands to check which processes are using the port:

*   On Linux and macOS:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    lsof -i :8080
    ```
    
*   On Windows:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    netstat -ano | findstr :8080
    ```
    

If you find another process using the port, terminate that process, or change the port number in your application.

4.  Use a different port:

If the issue persists, try using a different port number when starting your application. For example, you can use port 8081 instead:

python

```python
socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8081, debug=True)
```

I hope one of these suggestions helps resolve the issue. If the problem persists, please provide more information about your code and the specific error messages you are encountering, and I'd be happy to help you further.

> It seems not a problem of port. When I stop the program for 5 minutes and restart the program. The notice finally appears: \`(27457) wsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:8080\`. Why it does not appear in earlier attemps?

1 / 1

If the issue persists even after waiting for a few minutes before restarting the application, it may not be related to the port. There could be other factors causing the delay, such as system resource constraints or issues with your specific environment.

Here are a few suggestions to help you identify the cause of the delay:

1.  Monitor system resources:

Check your system's CPU, memory, and disk usage to determine if there are any resource constraints that could be causing the delay. You can use tools like Task Manager on Windows, Activity Monitor on macOS, or `top`/`htop` on Linux to monitor your system resources.

2.  Examine logs and error messages:

Inspect your application's logs and error messages to see if there are any warnings or errors that could be causing the delay. You can increase the logging level in your Flask application to get more detailed logs:

python

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

3.  Test in a different environment:

If possible, try running your application on a different machine or in a virtual environment to see if the issue is specific to your current environment. This will help you determine if the problem is related to your system or the application itself.

4.  Investigate other parts of your code:

It's possible that other parts of your code are causing the delay. Examine your code carefully to identify any potential bottlenecks or blocking operations, especially in the initialization phase of your application.

By following these suggestions, you should be able to identify the cause of the delay and resolve the issue. If the problem persists, please provide more information about your code, the specific error messages you are encountering, and any observations about your system resources, and I'll be happy to help you further.

> Why \`(27457) wsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:8080\` does not show up when I start the program by \`python app.py\`. It seems that my program is not listening and not serving

1 / 1

If the message `(27457) wsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:8080` does not show up when you start your program, it's possible that your application is not starting correctly or is getting stuck during initialization.

To help identify the issue, you can add print statements throughout your `app.py` script to see where the execution is getting stuck. Add a print statement at the beginning of your script and right before the `socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True)` line:

python

```python
print("Starting the application...")

# ... (your code)

print("Starting the SocketIO server...")
socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True)
```

This will help you determine if the application is getting stuck before reaching the `socketio.run()` line. If the "Starting the SocketIO server..." message is printed, but the server does not start, the issue might be related to Flask-SocketIO or the eventlet/gevent library.

Here are a few more suggestions to help you troubleshoot the issue:

1.  Test with the Flask development server:

To determine if the issue is related to Flask-SocketIO, try running your application with the Flask development server instead:

python

```python
# Comment out the SocketIO-related lines
# socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")
# socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True)

# Use the Flask development server
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```

If your application starts correctly with the Flask development server, the issue might be related to Flask-SocketIO or the eventlet/gevent library.

2.  Test with a minimal Flask-SocketIO application:

Create a minimal Flask-SocketIO application to see if the issue persists:

python

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_socketio import SocketIO

app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True)
```

If this minimal application works, the issue is likely related to other parts of your code, such as the worker threads or the database configuration.

3.  Check your environment:

Make sure you have the correct versions of Flask, Flask-SocketIO, eventlet, and any other libraries installed. Update them to the latest versions if necessary.

By following these suggestions, you should be able to identify the cause of the issue and resolve it. If the problem persists, please provide more information about your code, the specific error messages you are encountering, and any observations about your system resources, and I'll be happy to help you further.

> When I comment the worker process initialization, it starts normally. The code: \`\`\` def worker(): global worker\_idle while True: try: data = task\_queue.get(timeout=0.5) except queue.Empty: continue for i in range(worker\_count): eventlet.spawn(worker) \`\`\`

1 / 1

Since the application starts normally when you comment out the worker process initialization, it seems that the worker processes are causing the issue.

Here's an alternative approach using a custom class to encapsulate the worker behavior, making it easier to manage the worker threads:

1.  Create a `Worker` class:

Create a `Worker` class that handles the worker process behavior, and use the `__init__` method to spawn the worker thread using `eventlet.spawn()`:

python

```python
import eventlet

class Worker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thread = eventlet.spawn(self.run)

    def run(self):
        while True:
            try:
                data = task_queue.get(timeout=0.5)
            except queue.Empty:
                continue
```

2.  Start the worker threads:

Instantiate the `Worker` class to start the worker threads:

python

```python
workers = [Worker() for _ in range(worker_count)]
```

This will create the specified number of worker threads and store them in a list called `workers`. You can adjust the `worker_count` variable as needed.

By using this approach, you can better manage your worker threads and make it easier to handle their behavior.

If the issue persists, it might be helpful to add logging statements to your `Worker` class and other parts of your code to better understand where the application is getting stuck or encountering issues. This can help you identify potential bottlenecks or blocking operations that may be causing the problem.

> Why the program says \`Restarting with watchdog (inotify)\` when I first start the program. I'm not making changes to scripts so it's not auto-reloading

1 / 1

The message "Restarting with watchdog (inotify)" indicates that the Flask development server is using the Watchdog package with inotify to monitor your application files for changes, enabling auto-reloading whenever a file is modified. This behavior is enabled by default when you run your application with the `debug=True` option.

Even though you're not making changes to the files, the Flask development server may still display this message at startup, as it sets up the file monitoring system for auto-reloading.

If you don't want the Flask development server to use the Watchdog package and enable auto-reloading, you can disable the reloader by setting the `use_reloader` option to `False`:

python

```python
socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True, use_reloader=False)
```

Keep in mind that with the reloader disabled, you will need to manually restart your application every time you make changes to your code for the changes to take effect.

If you're using the Flask development server (`app.run()`), you can disable the reloader in a similar way:

python

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True, use_reloader=False)
```

> 1 / 1
> 
> That's important! I add \`use\_reloader=False\` to my program. It does not stuck on the initialization of worker threads and connection to sqlite. Maybe it's not compatible with multi-threads

1 / 1

Yes, it's possible that the auto-reloading feature of the Flask development server is causing issues with your multi-threaded application. The auto-reloader starts a separate process that monitors your application files for changes, and when a change is detected, it restarts the main process. This can sometimes lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior when working with multi-threaded applications, especially when using libraries like Eventlet or Gevent.

By setting `use_reloader=False`, you have disabled the auto-reloading feature, which might have resolved the issues with your worker threads and the SQLite connection.

Keep in mind that with the reloader disabled, you will need to manually restart your application every time you make changes to your code for the changes to take effect. This is generally not a problem during development, as you can quickly restart your application as needed.

If you continue to encounter issues with your multi-threaded application or if you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.

> When I use \`subprocess.check\_output\` in the worker threads. The webpage stucks on sending the create-row requests and I cannot take further operation. Is there a way to make worker process independent?

1 / 1

It seems that the use of `subprocess.check_output` in your worker threads might be causing the application to become unresponsive. This might be due to the blocking nature of `subprocess.check_output`, which waits for the command to complete before returning its output.

In this situation, you can use the `subprocess.Popen` class to run the command asynchronously, which should prevent the worker threads from blocking the main application. Here's an example of how to use `subprocess.Popen` with a callback function to achieve this:

python

> 1 / 1
> 
> Actually the worker threads can be unresponsive because it's not directly connected to frontend. My backend should be responsive, but it doesn't

1 / 1

In that case, it seems like the issue might be related to the way Flask-SocketIO and your worker threads are interacting with each other, causing the backend to become unresponsive. To help ensure that your backend remains responsive while the worker threads perform their tasks, you can make use of the `socketio.start_background_task()` method, which is designed for running background tasks in parallel with the main application without blocking it.

Here's an example of how to use `socketio.start_background_task()` with your worker function:

1.  Modify your `worker` function to remove the infinite loop:

python

```python
def worker():
    try:
        data = task_queue.get(timeout=0.5)
        # Add your subprocess.check_output logic here
    except queue.Empty:
        pass
```

2.  Schedule the worker function to run periodically:

python

```python
def schedule_worker():
    while True:
        socketio.start_background_task(worker)
        socketio.sleep(1)  # Adjust the sleep duration as needed

socketio.start_background_task(schedule_worker)
```

In this example, the `schedule_worker` function will run the `worker` function periodically (every 1 second) using `socketio.start_background_task()`. The `socketio.sleep()` function is used to avoid overloading the system with too many concurrent tasks.

By structuring your application in this way, you can ensure that your backend remains responsive while the worker threads perform their tasks without blocking the main application.

If the issue persists or if you need further assistance, please provide more information about your code, the specific error messages you are encountering, and any observations about your system resources, and I'll be happy to help you further.

> When I start the program, it prints "(3558) wsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:8080". But when I visit the site, it does not respond

1 / 1

If the server starts successfully but the site does not respond when you visit it, there might be an issue with the application itself or how Flask-SocketIO is handling the requests. To help diagnose the issue, try the following steps:

1.  Test with a minimal Flask-SocketIO application:

Create a minimal Flask-SocketIO application to see if the issue persists:

python

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_socketio import SocketIO

app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, '0.0.0.0', 8080, debug=True, use_reloader=False)
```

If this minimal application works, the issue is likely related to other parts of your code, such as the worker threads, the database configuration, or how the routes are defined.

2.  Examine logs and error messages:

Inspect your application's logs and error messages to see if there are any warnings or errors that could be causing the issue. You can increase the logging level in your Flask application to get more detailed logs:

python

```python
import
```
